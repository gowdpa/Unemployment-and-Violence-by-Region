#### About
This data repository analyzes the correlation between Unemployment and Violent Crime by region. It was created by using the raw data set "CountyHealthData2014-2015." The data set was manipulated down into a smaller subset of data using Python through Google CoLab. The repository includes the Python notebook documenting the process of creating the subset of data from the original data.
