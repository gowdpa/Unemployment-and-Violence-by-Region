# Unemployment and Violence by Region
This repository was created for English 105 in the Fall 2023 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill taught by Prof. Gotzler.

### About
- This data repository analyzes the correlation between Unemployment and Violent Crime by region. 
- It was created by using the raw data set "CountyHealthData2014-2015." This data is public data acquired from UNC Chapel Hill's Davis Library Research Hub. 
- The data set was manipulated down into a smaller subset of data using Python through Google CoLab. The repository includes the Python notebook documenting the process of creating the subset of data from the original data.

### Why It's Useful
This repository is intended to bring insight into the influence unemployment rates have on crime.

This repository can provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and community leaders. This analysis may help in developing targeted policies or strategies to address social issues and improve overall community well-being.

### What is Provided?
The repository contains: 
  1. The original data set. It is a .csv file named "CountyHealthData2014-2015.csv"
  2. The smaller data subset. It is a .csv file named "UseableData_subset.csv"
  3. The Python notebook containing the process documentation of getting from the original data set to the subset.

### What's Next?
- After looking at the README page, navigate to the "CountyHealthData2014-2015.csv" file. This file includes the original dataset. 

- To recreate this process used to create the data analyzed in this repository, download the data, then navigate to the "Data_Subset_Creation_Through_Python.ipynb" where you will find the process documentation to follow along. 
  - This will guide you to read the same data outcome as "UseableData_subset.csv" or you can use the steps to guide you towards a similar comparison with different data values.
